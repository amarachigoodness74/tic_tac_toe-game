# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is my first published react project and I built this game to lear React by doing and adding more features to learn more.

## Features

- Allows 2 players to play in turns
- Tells who the winner is - `Player X` or `Player O`
- Tells if no player won a round
- Displays steps played in `Asc` or `Desc` order
- Allows time travel to previously played steps
- Highlights the winning cells

## Steps to build locally
- Fork this repo  
- clone your fork
- cd into project directory  
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- The app will open on `localhost:3000`
